# titanic
Currently open challenge in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic (link to the challenge)

Challenge is to determine if a person survived in the titanic or not.

At my best I was able to predict prices for the test data with 78.229% success rate. 

The language I used for this challenge is R. 
I used feature engineering skills as well as models like svm, glm,dTree, and randomForest for these predictions.
